This project is finished as of 1/23/26.
Game wise, I am mostly content with it.  I do want to improve the way the game determines a tie.
The way it is currently setup, it will only detect a tie if there are currently no more possible victories available for either side.  
However there can be situations where even though the current board is not in a tie, all possible moves will lead to a tie. I would like for the game to be able to detect these situations.

Looking at the other odin project submissions, bots are another possible addition. Currently, I only have a vague idea in my head about how I would go about adding anything other than a random choice bot, but it might be something to return to in the future.

Visuals wise, I am very unhappy with how I am leaving this. I remembered an old Simpson's parody about a tic-tac-toe meets Star Wars cash grab. I tried to base some of the visuals off of that but I realized there was far less to that parody than I remembered.
I also simply was not very creative at all with this design.  The colors are basic and plain, I've reused this layout many times, and there are no animations.  Things just pop in and out of existence.

I decided to leave the visuals alone for now as the point of the project was the JS not the CSS, but if I return to this, I think I would like to redo the entire visual design from scratch.
